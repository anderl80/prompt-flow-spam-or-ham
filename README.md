# Purpose

> ðŸŒŠ Prompt Flow demo using Email classifier on spam or ham dataset.

The idea is to use this repository as a devcontainer to start with. There should be a GitHub Actions workflow that can be triggered to set up the workspace, run the flow, and evaluate the results. This allows for easy exploration of the UI either on VSCode or AML / AI Studio with a fresh experiment already executed.

# Todo

- [ ] Add automation to provision necessary resources and services using az cli
- [ ] Add automation to create connections
- [ ] Add automation to run flows and evaluate results
